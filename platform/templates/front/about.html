                <p>Our mission is rooted in the Gospel of Jesus, aiming to foster the reproduction of leaders who embody this sending in their daily lives. We believe that by coming together, we can create new expressions of the church that resonate with today's world while staying firmly grounded in timeless truths.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mt-8">

                    <li><strong>Sending:</strong> Inspired by the life of Jesus, we encourage and equip leaders to live sent daily, turning every encounter into an opportunity for Gospel expression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reproducing:</strong> Our core focus is on the reproduction of leaders who are equipped to foster new expressions of the church, ensuring a vibrant, growing faith community for generations to come.</li>

                <p>Our <b>vision</b> is to see new leaders and churches make disciples. A network that regularly sees churches collaborating with one another in a region for gospel impact. We see new leaders establishing missions and ministries among unreached groups not currently reached by the local church. We also envision marketplace leaders living sent to share the love of Christ to their coworkers in ways that make sense to them. With joy, we imagine marketplace leaders collaborating together to impact businesses and communities for the gospel.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold">Values</h2>
                <p>In our effort to live sent daily, to cultivate the Gospel into the lives of every person we encounter, and to speak the message that God came near, we emphasize these six core values: praying ceaselessly, resourcing together, developing leaders, shaping future, interconnecting relationships, and living sent.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pl-4 flex flex-col gap-6 mt-8">
                    <li class="flex flex-col gap-6"><strong>Praying Ceaselessly:</strong> <p>We are ever in prayer, communicating with God, making our requests to Him, always listening for His response, and responding accordingly (1st Thess 5:17). We are asking God for direction and wisdom on how to best be the church to the people who need Jesus. We are seeking God for His provision of the leaders necessary to lead the decentralization of the Gospel to the people in every place. (Mt 9:36-38). We respond to God and can change our plans at any time if we feel led by the Holy Spirit to make such changes (Acts 16:1-9).</p></li>
                    <li class="flex flex-col gap-6"><strong>Resourcing Together:</strong> <p>We see each local church as a part of “the church” – the movement of people that Jesus unleashed nearly 2000 years ago to simply eat together, pray together, believe in the potential of people, and draw it out as we draw closer to Christ and to one another (Matthew 16:18 and Acts 2:42). We care more about connecting people with Christ and a local body of Christ-followers than we do about just connecting them with our church. That’s because we have a heart for a region and a heart to partner together with any church that wants to make disciples. We see each new church as a means to Kingdom focus rather than an end in and of itself (Acts 9:31). We know that Jesus values His church existing on mission for the world to restore humanity rather than preserving herself (Genesis 3:15). We will stay external in our focus and simple in our pragmatism so that the local expression of the church is easily reproducible and so that the possibilities remain endless for every man, woman, and child to hear the message that God came near (Acts 1:8). We will generously share everything – people, money, creativity, resources, and life together (Acts 2:44).</p></li>
                    <li class="flex flex-col gap-6"><strong>Developing Leaders:</strong> <p>We trust that Jesus will always answer our prayer for leaders by sending leaders for His harvest (Matthew 9:36-38). We are trusting Him for the future leaders to come from those who will one day trust Him (1st Timothy 1:15-16). We believe that a true leader exists for the success of others rather than the promotion of self (1st Thessalonians 2:8). Leaders are interchangeable, mobile, and “position-less” and will be shared among the network for the greater benefit of the Kingdom (Matthew 20:25-28). Leaders will be developed within the context of relationships through the process of mentoring and internship, challenged in their very construct of church as a “who” and in practical methods of execution, and then unleashed to live to the fullest of how they are wired and gifted in their specific context (Mark 1:17 and Acts 19:10).</p></li>
                    <li class="flex flex-col gap-6"><strong>Shaping Future:</strong> <p>We believe that Jesus wants us to be “salt and light,” influencing leaders and culture and community by living sent among them, creating the collision of their circumstance with the reality of God, bring out the “God-flavor” God intended to be in and through them, and drawing them closer to the God who made them (Matthew 5:13-16). We want to be a sentence in the grander story of restoring the “who” of church and renewing the heart and expression of the church for the next generation (Titus 2).</p></li>
                    <li class="flex flex-col gap-6"><strong>Interconnecting Relationships:</strong> <p>We serve a Master who put on human skin in order to connect the message that God came near with all those He related with (John 1:14). We believe God is calling us to do the same – to value what He values about church and translate our personal relationship with Christ into the relationships we develop with others. (Romans 12:1-2). We aspire to be highly relational as Jesus was with His followers (John 10:11-14). As a coral reef is composed of connecting tissues and its strength and size increases as it expands, we believe that our churches should have interconnecting and interdependent relationships with one another, thus increasing our strength and impact for the Kingdom (Hebrews 10:19-25 and Ephesians 4:1-16). It is our desire to always place relationships over policies and organizational structures, and organize everything to best inspire and unleash people to live sent within our contexts and through their relationships (Galatians 5:13-15).</p></li>
                    <li class="flex flex-col gap-6"><strong>Living Sent:</strong> <p>Each of us (whether a “pastor”, a marketplace leader, or other) as Christ-followers are letters from God, declaring the message that He has come near and living near enough to our culture for them to read it (John 20:21 and 2nd Cor 3:1-6). We will live to love God, love people, and make disciples as we live in the daily among our family, alongside our neighbors, in the marketplace, around the world, and on the web (Matthew 28:18-20 and Mark 12:30-31). There is no division of “laity” and “clergy.” We are all able to live the message of Christ, and we are all needed and valuable and necessary in order to be the church the way Jesus intended. This is the basis for a church planting movement on a micro and macro level (1st Corinthians 12:12-31). Everyone is expected to be sent from their local body on some level, whether in living sent in their spheres of influence in the daily or to be the church in a new expression elsewhere (Acts 1:8 and Matthew 28:18-20).</p></li>

                <p>We are committed to having unity with ‘the same love, the same mind and the same purpose’ (Relationship, Belief, and Mission). This is the basis of our unity and togetherness. As an evangelical network, we can hold to varying beliefs as long as we are committed to these essential beliefs:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
                    <li>God is one eternal being, the creator of the world, and the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit</li>
                    <li>God has called people to be his servants and witnesses</li>
                    <li>The Bible is the only written word of God and the only infallible rule of faith and practice</li>
                    <li>The Church should work together to make Jesus Christ known throughout the world</li>
                    <li>Evangelism and social action are necessary and contingent upon each other</li>
                    <li>Only through faith in Jesus Christ may a person be saved</li>
                    <li>Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly to consummate his salvation and his judgment</li>
                    <li>The gospel is God's good news for the whole world</li>
                    <li>We should obey Christ's commission to proclaim the gospel to all mankind</li>
